<li>

Until i was 19 years old, i used to live in small village of punjab, <a href="http://www.onefivenine.com/india/villages/Moga/Nihal-Singh-Wala/Ransih-Kalan">Ransih Kalan</a>.

I created many memories down there. Ofcourse, i spent my entire childhood down there. So there are some bitter-sweet memories associated with it. More specifically of which

i remember is playing with my friends in the evening. I know you think that that’s part of every person’s childhood, but mine was different due to some of the reasons. Some of them are

<ol>

<li>

We didn’t get to play outside during the dark. It is a village so nights get very dark. Therefore we were not allowed to play outside after 9. But you know a child is always tend to

do that thing more that we stop them from doing. So me and my two best friends used to stay outside until 10. It was thrill that drives us and i miss that thrill that we used to have.

</li>



<li>

We used to play football most of the times. But not with the football, most of the time, I was just a can, bladder of the football, cricket ball or bottle. It was really rare that we had real

football.

</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>

Coming here in Canada, I think my most interesting experiences are also with my friends. Going to Hikes, Playing on sundays, Facetiming them, playing online games and eating out together etc.
